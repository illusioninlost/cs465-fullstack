CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN

Architecture

•	Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
•	Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

Express is a server-side rendering framework that generates template files to server. Angular is a single page application that generates its own file and updates the website dynamically. Both Express and Angular use a form of JavaScript as a programming language. Angular uses some typescript, which is a super script. Angular offers faster loading and responsive than those of Express.
No SQL is a popular choice for web applications due to its flexibility and scalability. Documents store objects with mixed formats. No relational database was required. MongoDB fits the qualifications and operates with high scalability and availability.


Functionality

•	How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
•	Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

JSON is a data interchange format that is human-readable. JSON uses JavaScript language.
JavaScript is a programming language for dnamic web applications.
JSON  ties together the frontend and backend development pieces by providing a standard format for data exchange between client and server.
Throughout the project process, I used the ideas of consistency, efficiency, and maintenance. When the trip card had all the trip object, a card component was made to separate the html into individual card components. Modularity provided the services and models in their respective app folders. Components were built based on CRUD requests in Angular


Testing

•	Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.

HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, and they can be implemented using technologies like REST, GraphQL, or SOAP. The methods are used to interact with the endpoints that are defined in the backend layer's APIs.
Endpoints, on the other hand, are specific URLs within the backend layer that the frontend layer can use to interact with the application's functionalities. Each endpoint corresponds to a specific operation or set of operations that the application can perform. 
Security is an essential consideration in any full stack application. There are several layers of security that can be implemented to ensure that the application is secure, and that user data is protected. Some of these security measures include user authentication and authorization, data encryption, input validation, and access control mechanisms.


Reflection

•	How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

This course has helped me to revisit a lot of development work in MEAN (mongo, express, angular, NodeJS). I learned some code workings in applications for older libraries during the coding of the traveling project. Development is also something that I have consistently improved on over the 4 years of development, more so if you count the personal years. I hear that technology evolves rapidly and steadily. New technologies and frameworks come out and as one, I am unable to always keep up. I have been in the software development field for about 4 years now.  I have used Postman, Angular, JWT, which were all incorporated into our project. I figure out that I need more soft skills than tech.  All the best!
